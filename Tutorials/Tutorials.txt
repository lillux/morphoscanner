This folder contains three tutorials covering the possible implementation of the Morphoscanner analysis workflow. 
The shown examples don't represent all the admissible workflows. Due to the modular features of Morphoscanner, 
it is possible to rearrange the analysis workflows and integrate them with other Python libraries.

EXAMPLE:
I - Analysis of CG-MD trajectory: Self-assembling peptides
II - Analysis of CG-MD trajectory: AQP4 embedded in Neuronal Membrane
III - Analysis of CG-MD trajectory & Protein Structure: Alpha-helix structures & Analysis of secondary structure patterns of a beta-clamp polymerase
