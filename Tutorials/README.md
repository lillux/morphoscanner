# Tutorials

This folder contains three tutorials covering the possible application of the Morphoscanner analysis workflow. 
The shown examples do not cover all the workflow possibilities. Due to the modular feature of Morphoscanner, 
it is possible to rearrange the analysis workflows and integrate them with other Python libraries.

Examples:

1. **Analysis of CG-MD trajectory**: Self-assembling peptides
2. **Analysis of CG-MD trajectory**: AQP4 embedded in Neuronal Membrane
3. **Analysis of CG-MD trajectory & Protein Structure**: Alpha-helix structures & Analysis of secondary structure patterns of a beta-clamp polymerase
