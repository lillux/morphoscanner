# Tutorials

This folder contains tutorials covering the possible application of the Morphoscanner analysis workflow. 
The shown examples do not cover all the workflow possibilities.
Due to the flexibility of Morphoscanner, it is possible to rearrange the analysis workflows and integrate them with other Python libraries.

Examples:

1. **Technical overview of the library + workflow**: Self-assembling peptides
2. **Analysis of Protein Structure**: Alpha-helix structures & Analysis of secondary structure patterns of a beta-clamp polymerase
